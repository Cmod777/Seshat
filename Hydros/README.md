## 1. Project Philosophy

HYDROS initially relied on **basic relative humidity thresholds (%)** to activate the dehumidifier. While simple, this approach proved inadequate:

- It ignored **temperature**, leading to activation even in cold/dry conditions, where dehumidification can be counterproductive.
- It didn't assess **perceived discomfort**, resulting in false positives/negatives.
- It failed to consider the **combined effect of temperature and humidity**.

To overcome these limitations, HYDROS was **completely redesigned** to use as its **main trigger**:

### **ADVANCED THERMAL COMFORT – Level 3**

Thermal comfort is calculated for each room using a Home Assistant algorithm that integrates:

- **Enthalpy**  
- **Humidex**  
- **Heat Index**

This model provides a realistic representation of perceived indoor discomfort, using the following simplified scale:

| Value | Meaning                 | Visual Code |
|-------|--------------------------|--------------|
| < 15  | Cold / Dry               | 🟣           |
| 15–18 | Fresh Comfort            | 🔵           |
| 18–22 | Optimal Comfort          | 🟢           |
| 22–26 | Slight Warmth            | 🟠           |
| 26–30 | Thermal Discomfort       | 🔴           |
| > 30  | Extreme Discomfort       | 🟣           |

### Why this is superior:
- Captures the **real perceived experience** of indoor climate.
- Adapts to **season, indoor temperature, and humidity** in context.
- Avoids unnecessary activations in winter, and ensures effectiveness in summer.

---

## 2. Humidity Fallback: Why It’s Still Included

Although HYDROS relies primarily on advanced thermal comfort metrics, it also includes an active **humidity fallback system**, which is triggered when:

- **Humidity exceeds the configured threshold** for any room by more than **10%**,  
- And this condition persists for at least **10 consecutive minutes**.

This mechanism is designed to:

- **React promptly to abnormal events**, such as post-shower spikes or water infiltration.
- **Ensure environmental comfort**, even when thermal comfort is below the main threshold but humidity is visibly out of range.

---

## 3. System Architecture

HYDROS is designed as a **standalone automation module**, operating independently from Home Assistant but fully integrated via its REST API.  
All logic and decision-making are handled within the script itself, making the system robust, traceable, and highly adaptable.

---

### 3.1 Core Components

- **`hydros.sh`**  
  The main script, responsible for:
  - Calculating thermal comfort
  - Activating/deactivating Midea or Sensibo
  - Handling fallback logic
  - Tracking energy consumption
  - Sending Telegram notifications
  - Saving logs in JSON and CSV format

- **`config.json`**  
  Configuration file containing:
  - Authentication tokens
  - Device IPs and credentials
  - Sensibo device IDs
  - Time intervals, thresholds, schedules, Home Assistant entities

- **`priorita.json`**  
  Operational thresholds and logic:
  - Global and room-specific comfort limits
  - Room-specific humidity limits
  - Shutdown deltas
  - Maximum cycle duration
  - Number of stagnant cycles before triggering fallback

- **Crontab + Watchdog**  
  - The script runs every 5 minutes via:
    - A secondary watchdog (`hydros_watchdog.sh`)
    - A `pgrep || nohup` fail-safe mechanism
  - This ensures **persistent automatic recovery**.

---

### 3.2 Execution Flow (simplified)

```text
[ START SCRIPT ]
       |
       v
[ Calculate average house comfort ]
       |
       +--> If below threshold → [ Exit ]
       |
[ Turn on Midea ]
       |
       v
[ Loop every N minutes ]
       |
       +--> Comfort below threshold → [ Exit ]
       +--> Stagnant comfort → [ Fallback: Sensibo ]
       +--> Humidity > threshold +10% → [ Fallback: Humidity ]
       |
[ Final Cleanup ]
       |
[ Log JSON + Telegram ]
```

---

## 5. Configuration

HYDROS is entirely driven by two external JSON files:

- `config.json` → General parameters, tokens, credentials  
- `priorities.json` → Room-level thresholds for comfort, humidity, cycle timing

Both are dynamically reloaded at runtime. No need to edit the main script.

---

### `config.json`

Contains:

- Home Assistant access configuration
- Telegram bot token and chat ID
- Midea IP and login credentials
- Sensibo API key and device IDs
- Sensor entity IDs (humidity, power)
- Runtime parameters (fan settings, intervals, schedules)

**Example:**

```json
{
  "HA_URL": "http://localhost:0000",
  "HA_TOKEN": "your-long-home-assistant-token",

  "TELEGRAM_TOKEN": "123456:ABC-DEF...",
  "TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID": "-1001234567890",

  "MIDEA_IP": "192.000.1.00",
  "MIDEA_USERNAME": "user@email.com",
  "MIDEA_PASSWORD": "password123",
  "MIDEA_CLOUD": "NetHome Plus",

  "SENSIBO_API_KEY": "abcdefgh123456",
  "SENSIBO_IDS": ["ABCDEF12", "XYZ78901"],
  "SENSIBO_NAMES": ["Bedroom", "Living Room"],

  "CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES": 3,
  "FAN_SPEED_NIGHT": "low",
  "FAN_SPEED_DAY": "high",
  "NIGHT_START_HOUR": 22,
  "NIGHT_END_HOUR": 8,

  "SENSOR_HUMIDITY_AVG": "sensor.avg_humidity_home",
  "SENSOR_HUMIDITY_LIVING": "sensor.humidity_living_room",
  "SENSOR_HUMIDITY_BEDROOM": "sensor.humidity_bedroom",

  "SENSOR_POWER_MIDEA": "sensor.power_midea",
  "SENSOR_POWER_CLIMATE": "sensor.power_climate"
}
```

---

### `priorities.json`

Defines:

- Acceptable humidity percentage per room
- Max comfort index before activation
- Shutdown delta
- Maximum run duration
- Fallback trigger conditions

> **Note on thresholds:**
>
> These thresholds are **scientifically defined**, not arbitrary.
>
> - **Humidity limits** follow international comfort standards (ideal range: 40–60%), with higher tolerance in bathrooms.
> - **Comfort thresholds** come from an advanced algorithm combining enthalpy, humidex, and heat index.
>   The activation threshold of `24` marks entry into the “slightly warm” range (22–26).
> - A **shutdown delta** of `0.5` avoids oscillations.
> - A **maximum cycle duration** of `30` minutes ensures failsafe operation.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "MAX_HUMIDITY_AVG": 55,
  "MAX_HUMIDITY_LIVING": 60,
  "MAX_HUMIDITY_BEDROOM": 60,
  "MAX_HUMIDITY_BATHROOM": 70,

  "MAX_COMFORT_AVG": 24,
  "MAX_COMFORT_LIVING": 24,
  "MAX_COMFORT_BEDROOM": 24,
  "MAX_COMFORT_BATHROOM": 25,

  "SHUTDOWN_DELTA": 0.5,
  "MAX_CYCLE_MINUTES": 30
}
```

---

## 6. Execution

The `hydros.sh` script can be launched manually, in background mode, or automatically using `cron`.  
It is designed to be **resilient, restartable**, and **self-recovering** in case of temporary failures.

---

### Manual Execution

To execute the script once from the shell:

```bash
bash hydros.sh
```

To enable **verbose debug mode** (console + file logging):

```bash
bash hydros.sh --debug
```

---

### Persistent Background Execution

To launch the script in the background using `nohup`:

```bash
nohup bash hydros.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

This ensures the script keeps running even if the terminal session is closed.

---

### Real-Time Log Monitoring

You can follow the debug log in real-time with:

```bash
tail -f logs/hydros_debug.log
```

To exit the live view without interrupting the script: press `CTRL + C`.

---

### Automatic Restart (cron + watchdog)

HYDROS supports two redundant mechanisms for self-restarting every 5 minutes.

#### Method 1 – Cron-based Watchdog

Add the following line to your user's `crontab`:

```cron
*/5 * * * * /bin/bash /home/ares/ML_scripts/hydros/hydros_watchdog.sh >> /home/ares/ML_scripts/hydros/logs/watchdog.log 2>&1
```

The watchdog can be extended to include checks such as:
- PID file validation
- Power sensor anomalies
- Network connectivity

#### Method 2 – Fail-safe Launcher

An additional cron line provides protection even if the watchdog fails:

```cron
*/5 * * * * pgrep -f hydros.sh > /dev/null || nohup /bin/bash /home/ares/ML_scripts/hydros/hydros.sh > /home/ares/ML_scripts/hydros/hydros_runtime.log 2>&1 &
```

This will launch the script **only if no instance is currently running**, ensuring persistent automation.

---

### Manual Shutdown and Cleanup

To terminate all HYDROS-related processes (main loop, energy logging, tank monitor):

```bash
pkill -f hydros.sh
pkill -f log_power_data
pkill -f monitor_midea_tank
```

To verify if any process is still running:

```bash
pgrep -f hydros.sh
```

---

### Behavior in Favorable Environmental Conditions

If thermal comfort is already **below the activation threshold** at launch time:

- The script performs a quick environmental check
- Logs the event with timestamp
- Exits silently **without sending any Telegram notification**

This makes HYDROS ideal for **periodic scheduling via cron**:  
It only acts **when needed**, operating fully autonomously.

---

## 7. Detailed Operation

HYDROS is designed to activate only under unfavorable environmental conditions.  
Its core logic consists of a periodic loop that monitors thermal comfort, humidity, and cycle duration, taking action **only when necessary**.

---

### 7.1 Main Activation (Thermal Comfort)

At startup, HYDROS calculates the **average thermal comfort of the home**, using three Home Assistant sensors (one per room):

- `sensor.advanced_comfort_bedroom`
- `sensor.advanced_comfort_livingroom`
- `sensor.advanced_comfort_bathroom`

Thermal comfort is evaluated on a numerical scale:

| Range   | Meaning              |
|---------|----------------------|
| < 15    | Cold/Dry             |
| 15–18   | Cool Comfort         |
| 18–22   | Optimal Comfort      |
| 22–26   | Slightly Warm        |
| 26–30   | Thermal Discomfort   |
| > 30    | Severe Discomfort    |

The default trigger threshold is **24.0**, marking the entry into the “slightly warm” zone.  
If the average comfort exceeds this threshold, the dehumidification cycle begins; otherwise, the script exits quietly.

---

### 7.2 Operational Loop

Once activated, HYDROS enters a loop that runs every `CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (e.g., 3 min):

- Recalculates average comfort
- Compares current and previous values
- Checks if shutdown threshold has been reached
- Checks if humidity exceeds any limits
- Detects comfort stagnation or worsening

The cycle ends automatically if:

- Comfort drops below shutdown threshold (`trigger - delta`)
- `MAX_CYCLE_MINUTES` is reached
- An error occurs (e.g., Midea device fails to start)

---

### 7.3 Fallback: Comfort Stagnation

If comfort does **not improve** for `MAX_CYCLES_NO_IMPROVEMENT` consecutive intervals, a **fallback is triggered** using Sensibo:

- Each room is analyzed individually
- If comfort or humidity is still high, the corresponding Sensibo unit is activated in `dry` mode
- Power usage logging is also started for Sensibo via Shelly

---

### 7.4 Fallback: Humidity Spike

A second fallback mechanism operates **independently of comfort** and is triggered when:

- Humidity in **any zone** (home, living room, bedroom, bathroom) exceeds its threshold by **more than 10%**
- The excess condition persists for **at least 10 continuous minutes**

Actions triggered:

- Attempt to activate the Midea dehumidifier (if not already running)
- If unavailable, activate Sensibo in the room where the spike occurred
- Start energy logging and send Telegram notification

This fallback is meant for localized anomalies such as:

- Bathroom steam after a shower
- Nighttime spikes in the bedroom
- Sensor malfunctions in the comfort algorithm

---

### 7.5 Midea Tank Monitoring

While running, a **background tank monitor** checks the Midea status every 15 minutes.  
If the value `tank_full: True` is detected:

- The dehumidifier is safely shut down
- A Telegram alert is sent
- The main cycle continues, using Sensibo fallback if needed

---

### 7.6 Energy Consumption Logging

HYDROS logs real-time power usage for both Midea and Sensibo:

- Data is written to temporary CSV files in the `tmp_logs/` folder
- At the end of the cycle, total energy in Wh is calculated via time interpolation
- Values are saved into the main JSON log and included in the Telegram summary

---

### 7.7 Final Cleanup

At the end of each cycle, HYDROS performs:

- Shutdown of all active devices
- Termination of background logging and monitoring processes
- Cleanup of all temporary files
- Export of final cycle data to `logs/hydros_log.json`
- Telegram summary including:
  - Total runtime
  - Initial/final comfort
  - Initial/final humidity
  - Energy consumed
  - Trigger cause (comfort, stagnation, or humidity)

This ensures each run is traceable, cleanly closed, and well-documented.

---

## 8. Logging & Notifications

HYDROS provides complete logging for each operation cycle using both a structured `JSON` log and concise Telegram notifications.  
These two output channels serve different purposes:

- **JSON log** → for structured analysis and persistent record keeping  
- **Telegram message** → for real-time human monitoring and alerts

---

### 8.1 JSON Log (`logs/hydros_log.json`)

At the end of each cycle, the script appends a structured JSON object to the file, containing full execution metrics.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "start": "2025-05-24 08:28:00",
  "end": "2025-05-24 08:58:00",
  "duration_min": 30,
  "initial_humidity_home": 58.2,
  "final_humidity_home": 52.6,
  "delta_humidity_home": 5.6,
  "initial_comfort_home": 25.1,
  "final_comfort_home": 21.8,
  "delta_comfort_home": 3.3,
  "power_consumed_midea_Wh": 201,
  "power_consumed_ac_Wh": 39,
  "total_power_Wh": 240,
  "fallback_comfort_triggered": true,
  "fallback_humidity_triggered": false,
  "midea_fan_speed": "high",
  "trigger_priority": "Comfort_Stagnation_Fallback",
  "sensibo_activated": ["Bedroom"]
}
```

**Explanation of key fields:**

- `start`, `end`: Start and end timestamps
- `duration_min`: Total duration of the cycle in minutes
- `*_humidity_home`: Initial/final humidity and difference
- `*_comfort_home`: Initial/final thermal comfort and difference
- `power_consumed_*`: Energy consumption in Wh
- `fallback_comfort_triggered`: Whether the comfort fallback was used
- `fallback_humidity_triggered`: Whether the humidity fallback was used
- `midea_fan_speed`: Fan mode used during the cycle (`low`, `high`)
- `trigger_priority`: Main reason for triggering the system
- `sensibo_activated`: List of Sensibo units activated during the cycle

---

### 8.2 Telegram Notification

If the cycle duration is greater than 0 minutes, HYDROS sends a **summary message via Telegram**.

**Example:**

```
HYDROS: Cycle completed.
Duration: 30 min
Comfort: from 25.1 to 21.8 (Δ 3.3)
Humidity (approx.): from 58.2% to 52.6%
Midea: 201 Wh
AC: 39 Wh
Total: 240 Wh

Fallback Comfort (Sensibo activated): Bedroom
```

**Conditional message blocks:**

- If the Midea tank was full:
  ```
  NOTE: Midea stopped due to full tank. Manual emptying required.
  ```

- If humidity fallback was triggered:
  ```
  Triggered by: Humidity Fallback
  ```

- If the cycle did not start or lasted 0 minutes:
  ```
  Cycle ended with 0 minutes duration. No Telegram message sent.
  ```

This provides **instant insight into system activity**, allowing for remote supervision without needing to open log files.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting & Environmental Testing

HYDROS is designed to be stable and autonomous, but during advanced testing or edge-case scenarios, unexpected behavior may occur. This section helps identify common problems and provides controlled test strategies.

---

### 10.1 Common Issues & Fixes

**The script does not start or exits immediately**
- Check the debug log:
  ```bash
  tail -n 30 logs/hydros_debug.log
  ```
- Likely cause: thermal comfort is already below threshold → normal behavior.
- Force a test run by setting `COMFORT_LIMIT_HOME` to a very low value (e.g. 15).

**Midea dehumidifier doesn’t turn on**
- Check:
  - IP and credentials in `config.json`
  - Local network connectivity between device and host
  - Command output:
    ```bash
    ~/home-scripts/midea-smarthack/venv/bin/midealocal status <IP>
    ```

**Sensibo units don’t activate**
- Verify `SENSIBO_IDS` and `SENSIBO_API_KEY` in `config.json`
- Test with curl:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET "https://home.sensibo.com/api/v2/users/me/pods?apiKey=..."
  ```

**Humidity fallback not triggering**
- Check:
  - `HUMIDITY_LIMIT_*` thresholds are realistic
  - Humidity sensors return valid values
  - Condition persists for **at least 10 continuous minutes**

**Energy log file is empty or zero**
- Ensure the `sensor.power_midea` and `sensor.power_climate` exist and return numeric data
- Check if temporary CSV file is being written inside `tmp_logs/` during the cycle

---

### 10.2 Suggested Manual Tests

**Simulate a forced cycle**
- Temporarily lower:
  ```json
  "COMFORT_LIMIT_HOME": 15
  ```
  to force activation even in a cool environment.

**Test humidity fallback**
- Set `HUMIDITY_LIMIT_BEDROOM` to a low value (e.g. 30)
- Increase real humidity or simulate values via Home Assistant

**Test automatic shutdown**
- While a cycle is running, artificially reduce comfort value
- Observe if script breaks and performs final cleanup

---

---

### 10.4 Quick Script Reset

To perform a clean restart of the system:

```bash
pkill -f hydros.sh

## 11. Functional Architecture & Roadmap

This section outlines the conceptual logic of HYDROS, highlighting state transitions, decision priorities, and automated actions. It serves both as a reference for future development and as a maintenance guide.

---

### 11.1 System Objective

HYDROS is an advanced script for **automated home dehumidification management**, featuring:

- Autonomous decision-making based on thermal comfort (enthalpy + humidex + heat index)
- Intelligent fallback based on per-room humidity thresholds
- Actuation via Midea dehumidifier (primary) and Sensibo climate units (secondary)
- Full logging: energy usage, duration, start/end conditions, active devices
- Telegram notifications: start, end, and errors

---

### 11.2 State Logic

Each script execution follows a defined state flow:

1. **Initial Condition Check**
   - Comfort below threshold → exit and log `"All OK, did not activate"`
   - Comfort above threshold → start cycle, log `"Trigger activated"` + Telegram alert

2. **Midea Activation**
   - Turn on with calculated fan speed
   - Immediately verify `power: true` state (via `status`)
   - Start real-time power logging (via Meross or HA sensor)

3. **Active Cycle**
   - Every `X` minutes:
     - Recalculate comfort
     - Check max duration
     - Evaluate shutdown threshold
     - Trigger fallback if comfort is stagnant

4. **Fallback: Stagnant Comfort**
   - After `MAX_NO_REDUCTION_CYCLES` without improvement
   - Activate Sensibo units room-by-room
   - Log power usage via Shelly
   - Track active Sensibo units (bedroom, living room)

5. **Fallback: Independent Humidity**
   - Triggered if any zone exceeds humidity threshold +10% for 10 minutes
   - Attempt to activate Midea, else fallback to room-specific Sensibo
   - Power logging for active units

6. **Cycle Termination (Cleanup)**
   - Turn off all active devices (Midea + Sensibo)
   - Stop all logging and monitoring processes
   - Compute energy usage from temp CSV files
   - Send Telegram summary
   - Save full JSON log

### 11.3 Trigger Types

| Priority              | Trigger Condition                            |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `Comfort_High`        | Average thermal comfort exceeds threshold     |
| `Comfort_Stagnant`    | No reduction in comfort for multiple cycles   |
| `Humidity_Too_High`   | Humidity > threshold +10% for 10 minutes      |
| `Midea_Tank_Full`     | Midea tank full → fallback to Sensibo         |

---

### 11.4 Triggered Actions

| Device     | Action              | Condition                             |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Midea**  | Turn on + fan speed | Comfort trigger or humidity fallback  |
| **Midea**  | Status check        | Immediately after activation           |
| **Midea**  | Power logging       | Only if device is ON                   |
| **Sensibo**| Activate dry mode   | When fallback is triggered             |
| **Sensibo**| Power logging       | If ON, via Shelly sensor               |
| **Telegram** | Start notification | Immediately after trigger              |
| **Telegram** | End notification   | After cleanup with full summary        |

## 13. Technical Insights, Requirements, and Safety

This section provides advanced information on technical requirements, scientific foundations, and key health considerations for safe use of the HYDROS system.

---

### 13.1 Minimum Technical Requirements

To ensure proper execution of `midealocal` commands, version **6.0.0** of the `midea-local` library must be used.

> Newer versions (e.g. 6.1.x) introduce so-called "security patches" that actually contain **known bugs**:
> - Malfunctioning `setattr` and `status` commands
> - Critical error: `Namespace object has no attribute get_sn`
> - Inability to communicate with Midea devices even with valid credentials

**Solution:** downgrade to version `6.0.0`:

```bash
pip install midea-local==6.0.0
```

---

### 13.2 Reference Standards for Comfort and Humidity

Comfort and humidity thresholds used by HYDROS are **not arbitrary** — they are based on international health and building standards.

#### Optimal Indoor Humidity Levels

| Source                             | Recommended Range         |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| World Health Organization (WHO)    | 40% – 60%                 |
| ASHRAE Standard 55 (USA)           | 30% – 60% (temperate zones) |
| Italian Ministry of Health         | 40% – 55%                 |

> Deviations from these ranges can lead to:
> - Mucosal dryness (< 30%)
> - Mold, dust mite, and bacterial growth (> 60%)

---

### 13.3 Advanced Thermal Comfort – Scientific Basis

HYDROS uses a custom composite index to evaluate perceived thermal comfort, based on:

- **Enthalpy (h)**: Total heat in the air (sensible + latent), reflects effective thermal load
- **Humidex**: Canadian index combining temperature and relative humidity to assess discomfort
- **Heat Index**: Apparent temperature based on temperature and humidity, used in meteorology

> A weighted average of these metrics is computed for each room.  
> The 24.0 threshold is selected to **trigger actions as soon as "warm tendency" is detected**, optimizing both energy efficiency and wellbeing.

---

### 13.4 Sanitary Risks: Legionella and Contamination

The use of dehumidifiers implies **known microbiological risks**, especially:

#### Legionella pneumophila
- **Hazardous bacterium** that can proliferate in stagnant water tanks
- Causes **Legionellosis**: a serious airborne pulmonary infection

**Safety recommendations:**
- Clean tanks and filters regularly with proper antibacterial products
- Avoid stagnant water and organic residue accumulation

---

### 13.5 Built-in Safeguards (Specific Case)

This implementation includes the following health-oriented protections:

- **Post-dehumidification drying cycle**:
  - Sensibo ACs (if used as fallback) automatically **run forced ventilation at the end of each cycle** to eliminate residual moisture
- **Time limits and control logic**:
  - Devices are never left active unnecessarily
  - Tank full and fallback failure scenarios are handled gracefully

For users without auto-dry features:
- Manually enable `fan` mode for 10–15 minutes after each `dry` cycle
- Or create an equivalent automation in Home Assistant

---

### 13.6 Summary

HYDROS is more than just a script — it is a system **built on scientific, technical, and hygienic principles**, designed to operate within health, environmental, and electrical standards.

Users are responsible for maintaining physical devices. However, HYDROS provides a solid foundation to automate indoor comfort management safely and consciously.

---

### 13.7 Future Development: HYDROS OPTIMIZER – Dynamic Automation Layer

A future extension of HYDROS may include a **secondary interactive script** that dynamically **overwrites configuration files** (`config.json`, `priorita.json`).

#### Objective

To allow **automated and controlled adjustment** of operational parameters (comfort thresholds, humidity limits, fan speeds, max durations, etc.) based on:

- **Seasonal changes** (e.g. summer vs winter)
- **Weather forecasts** (incoming storms, high humidity, dry spells, etc.)
- **External events** (other scripts like `zephyrus`, `prometheus_v2`, etc.)
- **Custom time profiles** (e.g. different behaviors at night or weekends)

#### Expected Operation

- The script will edit `*.json` config files programmatically
- Only selected parameters will be modified based on predefined logic
- It may be triggered manually or automatically by other systems
- A modification log will be maintained for traceability

#### Benefits

- **Seasonal adaptability** without manual edits
- Optimization based on real or forecasted conditions
- Compatibility with future **machine learning predictive logic**

---

> This evolution would make HYDROS not only reactive, but **proactive and self-adaptive** over time — closing the loop between environment, forecasts, comfort, and energy usage.
